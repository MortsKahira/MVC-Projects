# C# & JavaScript Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I store and showcase projects developed using **C#** for backend logic and **JavaScript** for frontend design. My focus is on building structured, scalable, and efficient applications, mainly using **.NET MVC, SQL Server**, and **modern JavaScript frameworks**.

## 📌 Technologies Used

### Backend:
- C# (.NET MVC, Web API)
- SQL Server (Stored Procedures, Query Optimization)
- Entity Framework (EF Core)
- DevExpress (PDF generation, UI components)

### Frontend:
- JavaScript (Vue.JS, jQuery, Axios)
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Select2 (for enhanced dropdowns)
- jsPDF, html2canvas (for PDF generation)

## 🚀 Projects Overview
This repository contains various projects related to:
- **Data Management:** CRUD operations using .NET MVC and SQL Server.
- **Frontend Interactions:** Dynamic UI enhancements with JavaScript & jQuery.
- **PDF Generation:** Exporting data to PDFs using jsPDF & html2canvas.
- **Stock & Inventory Management:** Handling stock transfers and transactions.
- **Finance & Payments:** Implementing payment processing logic with Amount allocation.
